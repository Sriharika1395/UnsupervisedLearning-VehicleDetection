# UnsupervisedLearning-VehicleDetection
The data contains features extracted from the silhouette ofvehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles wereused for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van,Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particularcombination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation thatthe bus, van and either one of the cars would be readilydistinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguishbetween the cars.
In the notebook Principal Component Analysis(PCA) has been used to train the model
